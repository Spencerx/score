 * It is instatiated exactly once and is accessible via the application
 * context,
 * score::ApplicationContext :
 *
 * @code
 * auto& plugin = context.applicationPlugin<MyApplicationPlugin>();
 * @endcode
 *
 * The loading procedure is as follows :
 *
 * - prepareNewDocument is called for all plug-ins.
 *
 * - Creation of a Document.
 * - Creation of a DocumentModel
 * - on_initDocument is called for all plug-ins.
 *
 * * New document case :
 * - The document delegate is created
 * - on_newDocument is called for all plug-ins.
 *
 * * Loaded / restored document case :
 * - The document delegate is loaded
 * - The SerializableDocumentPlugin are loaded (see
 * score::DocumentPluginFactory)
 * - on_loadedDocument is called for all plug-ins.
 *
 * Finally, on_createdDocument is called for all plug-ins.
 * If the document becomes visible, on_documentChanged is called for all
 * plug-ins.
